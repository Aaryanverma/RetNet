# RetNet
An implementation of [Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer
for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08621.pdf) in PyTorch.

## About this repository
This is a minimal, pure pytorch implementation of RetNet. RetNet paper: [Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer
for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08621.pdf) in PyTorch.

The contributors(s) to this repository are not authors of the original paper. All credit for the idea and formulation of RetNet goes to the original authors.

The purpose of this repository is to aid scientific and technological understanding and advancement. The code prioritizes correctness and readability over optimization.

## Features implemented
* Single-scale and MultiScale retention:
  - parallel paradigm
  - recurrent paradigm
* Multi-layer retentive network with FFN and LayerNorm
  - parallel paradigm
  - recurrent paradigm
* Causal language model (CLM) built on top of the the retentive network

## Features coming soon:
* chunkwise recurrent paradigm (for efficient inference)

## Usage and Examples:
* See scripts prefixed with `test_` for examples of basic usage

## Differences to original paper
While the paper contains no explicit references to complex algebra, this implementation uses `torch.ComplexFloat` (64-bit) for parameters and data throughput. This has some limitations due to there not yet being torch support for half-precision complex types. It also requires twice the amount of memory as real-valued data at 32-bit precision.

## Known Issues
* Error propagation: it appears in this implementation, errors propagate differently between the parallel usage and the recurrant usage. It's not yet clear whether this is a bug, or instead a result of imprecision in floating point arithmetic, but it sometimes causes tests to fail.
